Therefore, so as to line a basis for comparison, i would like to search out a rental unit subject to the subsequent conditions:\n",
    "- lodging with min a pair of bedrooms with monthly rent to not exceed US$7000/month\n",
    "- Unit situated inside walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km) from a subway railway line station in Manhattan\n",

    "I believe this can be a relevant project for someone or entity considering moving to a serious town in Europe, the United States or Asia since the approach and methodologies used here area unit applicable all told cases. the utilization of FourSquare information and mapping techniques combined with information analysis can facilitate resolve the key queries arisen. Lastly, this project could be a smart follow case toward the event of knowledge Science skills.\n"
